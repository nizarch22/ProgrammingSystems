make is used to automate the compilation (and cleaning) process of the code. 
Before using make, navigate to any of the hw folders. In each folder there is a Makefile, which is necessary to use the command 'make'.

To use make, type into terminal:
make // compile but not run file.
make run // an arbitrary test run
make clean // wipe away all 'make' and 'make run' files.
